# robotronikk
A repository for documenting my robotics projects

## about
I'm fascinated by robots and robotics and I wanted to build robots for quite some time now. In 2015 I started my first building project when I found a DIY robot kit at a Conrad store in Leipzig/Germany during the annual Digital Humanities in the German-speaking Countries conference. I build it in one evening, learning soldering and some practical microelectronics alongside. I also became member of the Oslo-based robot club NorBot which has its headquarters at BitRaf, Oslo's biggest Hacker- and Makerspace. I contributed to NilBot, an autonomous racing robot that competed in May 2016 at the Swedish Championships in Gothenburg (Chalmers Campus). I have some more robot builds lined up, however, in the meantime I take classes in robotics via FutureLearn MOOC platform: "Begin Robotics" by University of Reading (Feb 2016) and "Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python" by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (Feb 2017).
I documented some of my robot projects on the NorBot Wiki and on my personal website.

## wiki
Documentation of the most current robotics project is done on the [wiki](https://github.com/arockenberger/robotronikk/wiki).

## code
All code for the robotics projects can be found [here](https://github.com/arockenberger/robotronikk/tree/master/code).

## name
The name of the repo – robotronikk – is a trifold homage: first, to my home region, the Thuringian Forest, where during the German Democratic Republic-period a devision of the [Kombinat Robotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEB_Robotron) factories was located. Second, it is a reference to my love for the Slavonic, especially the Russian language where the word 'robot' derived from the verb 'to work' comes from. Third, it makes use of a peculiarity of the Norwegian language (the language of my chosen home country) that ends words on k with a double hard consonant 'kk', like musikk, informatikk etc.
